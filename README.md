# EtchASketch
This is a Basic EtchASketch project for The Odin Project.
My design is inspired by the real Etch A Sketch drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes.

## Instructions
Black Pen - Colors in squares black as you move over them.

Color! - Paints a random color on the canvas.

Gradual Shading- Will gradually make squares darker each time you go over them.

Clear Grid - Will reset the current drawing area.

Reset - Will resize the ammount of pixels in drawing area.

# Info
made by Aliyu Sadiq using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Challenges:
This took a lot of time given it had to be done using plain javascript. However, I was able to understand the way DOM works through this project and learn some few tricks of implementing javascript also.
